# Ignore indirect dependency vulnerability caused by
# https://github.com/kubernetes/apiextensions-apiserver importing v2.x of
# emicklei/go-restful, which can lead to bypassing the CORS policies.
# Since we are not able to force update the dependency to v3 due to changes
# in the package's api, we choose to ignore it until Kubernetes v25 is released.
# With this release the apiextensions-apiserver repository updated the dependency
# to v3.8.0, making it even across all imported Kubernetes dependencies.
